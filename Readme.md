#SLACK-HACK
A product using SLACK and hosted in AWS to display unread messages of different channels in a single webpage.
##Description
  The product involves the Authorization - access via SLACK to get involved into the database and get the information about the messages and workspace involved, channels present in user's database. Using different APIs we access the data and re-direct the user to a website . In this way the ease of usage is increased and the complexity to get access to the messages is reduced. It allows us to get the unread messages as our first priority and make ease of usage efficient reducing the complexity of the access of messages. We can get all our unread messages in a single screen in a single click, also we can multitask and engage and get connected to more than one channel in a workspaces.
